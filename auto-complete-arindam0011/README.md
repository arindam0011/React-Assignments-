# Auto Complete React

#### Implement a React component that implements an autocomplete feature for a search input. The component should display a list of suggestions as the user types in the input, and should update the suggestions list asynchronously to prevent UI freezes.

- Use array fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry", "fig"]
